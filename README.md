# FoundationModelsExtras

[![CI](https://github.com/swissarmyhammer/FoundationModelsExtras/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/swissarmyhammer/FoundationModelsExtras/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Shared substrate for the swissarmyhammer FoundationModels family: a
cross-package slash-command vocabulary, a layered `DotfolderStack` for
locating config across defaults/user/project directories, and a
Stencil-backed `TemplateEngine` for rendering the content that lives in
them — with a whitelist-and-budget sandbox for rendering untrusted,
user-authored templates.

```swift
import FoundationModelsExtras
import Foundation

let stack = DotfolderStack(
    name: "myagent",
    workingDirectory: URL(fileURLWithPath: FileManager.default.currentDirectoryPath)
)

let engine = TemplateEngine(partials: stack)

var context = TemplateContext()
context.set(key: "name", to: .string("world"))

// `trust: .untrusted` runs a tag/filter whitelist plus include-depth,
// output-size, and iteration budgets -- for content it didn't ship itself,
// use `.trusted` for its own shipped defaults.
let greeting = try engine.render(
    "Hello {{ name }}! Config lives under .{{ dotfolder_name }}/.",
    context: context,
    trust: .untrusted
)
// greeting == "Hello world! Config lives under .myagent/."
```

## Install

Add the package to `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/swissarmyhammer/FoundationModelsExtras.git", branch: "main")
```

## Documentation

Design rationale -- the dependency-diamond problem this package solves, all
three pillars, and the untrusted-template sandbox's threat model -- is in
[`plan.md`](plan.md).
